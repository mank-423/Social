1. Real-Time Presence + Active Users
Show online/offline status, typing indicators (user is typing...), last seen.
Socket pinging (emit ping every X seconds) and presence tracking.

2. Group Chats with Admin Roles
Create public/private groups.
Roles: Admin can add/remove members, change group name/image.
Allow muting members or setting permissions.


3. Media Uploads (Images, Audio, Docs)
Upload to Cloudinary / S3 and send media in messages.
Previews: Images auto-preview, audio messages playable.


4. Message Statuses (Sent, Delivered, Seen)
Like WhatsApp: single tick (sent), double tick (delivered), blue tick (seen).
Implement using socket events, and update on receiver open/chat focus.

5. End-to-End Encryption (Optional but Massive Value)
Use Diffie-Hellman key exchange or simple symmetric encryption like AES between users.
Backend just relays ciphertext.


6. Chat Search + Filters
Fuzzy search: Search within chats, messages, users.
Filter by date, unread, media, etc.


7. Notifications System
Browser Notifications (Notification API) when a message arrives.
Badge count + optional email/push notification setup via Firebase.


8. Dark Mode + Theme Persistence (Properly!)
Store in localStorage, sync on login, and make server-side rendered pages theme-aware.
